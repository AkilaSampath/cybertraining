## Project Title

1D Fractal Cloud Model

This code generates a 1 dimensional (denoted x) cloud model of cloud optical thickness. 

## Related Code

fractal_cloud_generation.py
RunFCGcode.ipynb

## Getting Started

The code is written in python as a python notebook (using Jupyter or something similar). To run, open
the file in python notebook and run each line. You can change the parameters f, xorder, and xdist to see 
changes. These parameters are described in the technical report. 

### Prerequisites

Python
Python notebook (like Jupyter)

### Installing

No installation necessary.

## Running the tests

Open the RunFCGcode.ipynb file and hit the "Run" button. It outputs an .nc file named 
'test.nc.' The code also shows how to access .nc files in Python.
