File Directory: Each directory listed below has its own README file

2DSurrogateCloudGeneratorVer0.1 - folder containing files for running the two-dimensional surrogate 
				  cloud model. All code is written in MATLAB. 

FractalCloudGeneratorver0.1     - folder containing files for running the one-dimensional fractal cloud
                                  model. All code is written in PYTHON. 

SHDOM_MG2			- folder containing files for running the radiative transfer model (SHDOM).
		                  Scripts are also provided for data analysis and discussion.

Cut_cloud_scene			- Folder containing files for cutting 50 km by 50 km cloud scenes using 
				  raw MODIS data. Code is written in PYTHON.
