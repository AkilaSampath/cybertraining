Title: Spatio-Temporal Climate Data Causality Analytics – An Analysis of ENSO’s Global Impacts 

Team members: Hua Song, Jing Tian, Jingfeng Huang

Mentors: Jianwu Wang and Zhibo Zhang

Additional help from Pei Guo

There are three folders:

Causality: 
The codes here are written to find the causality relation between ENSO index and some climate variables
The codes are written in Python

Max_Lag_Correlation:
The codes here are written to calculate maximum lag correlation between ENSO index and some climate variables
The codes for reading data are written in Python.
The codes for plotting the results are written in NCL.

Plot_Model_Results:
The codes are used to visualize our model results from sensitivity simulations.
The codes are written in NCL.

The datasets analyzed for this study can be found in HadISST at https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/hadobs/hadisst/, NCEP/NCAR at https://www.esrl.noaa.gov/psd/data/gridded/data.ncep.reanalysis.html, and Global Precipitation Climate Project Precipitation (GPCP) at https://www.esrl.noaa.gov/psd/data/gridded/data.gpcp.html.
